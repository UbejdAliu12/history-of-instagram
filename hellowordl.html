<h2>History of Inestagram</h2>
<p>Instagram[a] is an American photo and video sharing social networking service founded by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. In April 2012, Facebook Inc. acquired the service for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock. The app allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters and organized by hashtags and geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations and view trending content. Users can like photos and follow other users to add their content to a personal feed.[10]

    Instagram was originally distinguished by only allowing content to be framed in a square (1:1) aspect 
    ratio with 640 pixels to match the display width of the iPhone at the time. In 2015, these restrictions
     were eased with an increase to 1080 pixels. The service also added messaging features, the ability to
      include multiple images or videos in a single post, and a 'stories' feature—similar to its main 
      competitor Snapchat—which allows users to post photos and videos to a sequential feed, with each
       post accessible by others for 24 hours each. As of January 2019, the Stories feature is used by   500 
    million users daily.[10]</p>
